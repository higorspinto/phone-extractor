# Phone Extractor

The application visits a given list of websites and outputs the websiteâ€™s logo, and
any found phone numbers.

The Phone Extractor matches different phone formats and identifies phones that contains any separators, hyphen `-`, white space ` `, or dots `.` between the branch number and the phone number. It also identifies phones that contain the area code between parentheses `(AREA_CODE)`.

Examples:

```
(517) 788-0550 - Valid
517 788 0550 - Valid
5177880550 - Not valid
```

```
+1 (212) 465-9555 - Valid
+1 212 465 9555 - Valid
12124659555 - Not Valid
```

To scrape the website logos, the Phone Extractor looks for the string pattern `logo` (case insensitive) in all the images found on the page and returns a list containing all the matches found.
